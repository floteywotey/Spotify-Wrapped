        <h1>Our Inspiration & Theme</h1>
        <p>
            Our project was inspired by Greg, Greg stared at his toaster, willing it to work faster. "Come on, I have
            ideas waiting," he muttered.
            The bread popped up, lightly singed, and he grabbed it with the zeal of a mad scientist uncovering a
            breakthrough. He bit into the toast,
            crunch echoing in the kitchen. And then—eureka! The idea struck like lightning. “What if,” he whispered,
            crumbs flying,
            “I made an app that tracks how toasted your toast gets?!” His cat, unimpressed, yawned. “Don’t give me that
            look, Whiskers!
            Genius isn’t always appreciated in its time,” Greg declared, toast app already being drafted in his head.

            The stars shimmered above the Tanabata festival, lanterns swaying like tiny moons caught in the wind.
            Children laughed as they wrote wishes on
            colorful strips of paper, tying them to bamboo stalks that seemed to reach for the heavens. Mai gazed up at
            the summer sky, imagining Hikoboshi and
            Orihime—the star-crossed lovers separated by the Milky Way—meeting once more. “Do you think they’re happy
            tonight?” she asked her grandmother,
            who smiled gently. “They’re together, aren’t they?” came the reply. Mai nodded, her heart light as she tied
            her own wish: May we all find a love that
            bridges galaxies.

                    The glow of the monitor bathed Alex’s face in hues of blue and white, the only light breaking the
                    midnight stillness.
                    Fingers danced across the keyboard, each keystroke a rhythm, a heartbeat, in the silence. Lines of
                    code unfolded on the screen,
                    cascading like poetry written in syntax and logic. A bug interrupted the flow, a red error glaring
                    like an accusatory eye.
                    Alex leaned in closer, brows furrowing, the thrill of the puzzle overtaking any frustration.
                    Debugging wasn’t a chore—it was a conversation.
                    At last, success. The program ran smoothly, and Alex leaned back, smiling. Creation complete. LOL
